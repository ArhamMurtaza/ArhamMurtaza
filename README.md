Full-stack developer.
Mostly solving problems, keeping things fast, and not overcomplicating what doesn’t need it.

$ cat about.txt

I work on production systems full-time.
Most of my day-to-day code lives in private repositories.
I enjoy building things that are simple, performant, and easy to reason about.

When something feels slow, messy, or over-engineered, I try to fix that first.

$ cat principles.md

- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Performance matters early
- Clear code > smart code
- Ship, observe, refine

$ cat work.log

• Full SaaS applications (frontend & backend)
• Admin panels & internal dashboards
• Chat systems & real-time features
• Browser extensions
• Automation & internal tooling

$ cat now.md

- Working full-time on production systems
- Improving performance & developer experience
- Learning selectively, not collecting tools

$ ls tech/

nextjs   react   typescript   tailwind
python   postgres   laravel   vue

$ echo "Most real work is private. Public repos are for experiments, notes, and tooling."

$ exit
